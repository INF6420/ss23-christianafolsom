# Christie Folsom's INF 6420 Project

A portfolio site showcasing my work as a youth services librarian and sharing it with others.

## Wireframes

I have worked on several wireframes to outline the possible layout of my site and what some of my pages will look like. 

The first thing I did was create a few pen and paper wireframe sketches to get out all my ideas.

After sketching out ideas, I created more detailed wireframes for my website using Adobe Illustrator.
