            <h2>A Book Talk on "Betty: The Helen Betty Osborn Story" By David Alexxander Robertson</h2>
            <p>Lets talk about Betty: The Helen Betty Osborne story. You may not have heard of Betty Osborne, but you
                should. Her story, and the story of murdered and missing indigenous women like her has too often gone
                untold. But in David Alexander Robertson’s beautifully stark graphic novel, Betty’s story has been given
                new life.</p>

            <h2>A Book Trailer on "Herizon" By Daniel w. Vandever</h2>
            <p>This book trailer was created to highlight Herizon by Daniel W. Vandever as part of INF 6520 at Wayne
                State University. The story is a wordless picture book about a young girl who must save her family's
                sheep using a magical scarf. I highly recommend checking out the full story! I've included a few
                resources below to do so!

            <h2>A Book Review on "Midlesex" By Jeffrey Eugenides</h2>
            <h3>5/5 Stars!</h3>
            <div><img src="images/middlesexcover.jpg" alt="cover of Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides"></div>
            <p>This unique novel tells not one story, but several as it weaves through three generations of the
                Stephanides family. Cal (or Callie), the narrator and protagonist is a hermaphrodite man of Greek
                descent with a condition known as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which causes him to have certain
                feminine traits. He explains his own story by telling the journey of the family carrying the genetic
                defect that leads to his condition. The gene originates in Greece and migrates with Cal's grandparents
                from Smyrna to Detroit, Michigan. It then follows down the line passing to Cal's parents and finally
                taking hold in Cal him/herself. The story combines Greek culture, with the history of Detroit and the
                experiences of coming to terms with an intersex diagnosis. Jeffrey Eugenides, the author, decided to
                write Middlesex after he read the 1980 memoir Herculine Barbin and was unsatisfied with its discussion
                of intersex anatomy and emotions.</p>
            <p>Even though it took me three weeks to read, this book was well worth it. As someone who grew up in
                Detroit, I felt excited, proud and sad to see the city depicted at it's most historical defining
                moments. It validated a city that I had come to view as decrepit and validated the experiences of my
                relatives who had lived it's history. As Cal's grandfather goes to work in the Ford Rouge plant, I saw
                my own grandfather taking in the smell and sweat of the factory. Durring the books depictions of the
                race riot I saw, not the Stephanides, but my own family, hiding in their attic as the city burned. I
                also felt very connected to Cal, and was glad to see a depiction of intersexness. The idea of
                experiencing aspects of both genders is so foreign to us, gender seems so black and white. I think
                Eugenides did a great job of showing how Cal could feel connected to both genders.</p>
            <p>I don't know if this book really fits the YA genre like I originally thought. When I first began reading,
                I thought it was the story of a teenager who finds out they are intersex and their subsequent journey
                twards acceptance, bla bla bla, etc. I didn't realize that Cal's story of her confusing adolescence
                doesn't begin until half way through the book. I also think, because of the themes and references it
                presents, that Eugenides probably was writing to an adult audience. That being said, I'm glad I was
                confused because I loved this book and I don't think we should rule out YA readership. Maybe this book
                isn't for every teen reader, but it is for some. I think specific parts could be especially useful in
                history teaching, or as a way to give teens in the LGBTQ community a story of intersex experiences.</p>
