        <p>  California Dreamin’ is a Biographical Graphic Novel on the life of Cass Elliot, originally Ellen Cohen, before she became the famous “Mama Cass” of The Momma’s and The Papas. Each chapter of the novel is told from the perspective of someone different in Cass’s life. Her sister, father, friends, music teacher, band mates all take turns telling us the story of her life as she grows from a normal childhood in Baltimore, though high school days as a drama club ingénue, to a struggling artist in New York and finally as she finds major success, releasing the 1965 smash hit “California Dreamin’”.  </p>

        <p>
            Thought the biography, author and illustrator Pénélope Bagieu captures the life of a beautiful, determined, enigmatic woman who fought against fatphobic stereotypes her entire life and career. Bagieu causes readers to fall in love with this powerhouse of a woman, with a voice so strong that it could not be denied or ignored. Cass does not just dream of California, she makes it there. And in doing so she paves the way for people of all sizes to dream that dream as well.

        <p> We were there, fighting on the battlefields of 1870s México and mourning at the 1994 funeral of Kirk Cobain. We’ve painted in artist studios in 1600s Amsterdam, and we’ve danced to disco music in 1970s roller rinks. Queer people have always been a part of history, and in All Out those stories are being beautifully and magically told. Many of the stories in this anthology are reclaiming old familiar tales from history with the inclusion of more diverse heroes and villains, and still others are brand new stories giving a voice to the LGBTQIA people who existed in different periods of time. These tales are varied throughout not just time and location, but also genre. While most of the anthology is traditional historical fiction, many of the stories have elements of fantasy, magical realism or horror. This gives the anthology an overall dreamlike quality that makes it very enjoyable to read.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Short story anthologies often get overlooked on the shelves, but All Out is a perfect example of why they can be a great choice for pleasure reading. First, there is just the sheer variety of different unique histories, characters and author perspectives within this collection. It is just a beautiful summer garden of different sights and smells and experiences.  And because they are short, all those unique stories are incredibly potent and powerful. While a novel is like a lovely cup of tea, a short story is a shot of espresso. With limited words, every word becomes important, themes can be explored with more intensity. These are stories that stick with you. As I’ve read through All Out, I've found my brain just continuing to think back these tales long after I've finished reading them. I’ve also found myself re-reading some of my favorites from this collection and getting something completely new with each re-read. And finally, there is incredible versatility to an anthology like this. You don’t have to read this book cover to cover. All Out, like history itself is timey wimey wibbily wobbly.  You can pick the historical periods you like best to read first, you can go back and re-read your favorites, you can skip the stories that don’t speak to you. I really enjoyed the choice I had as a reader while going through this book.

            As a lesbian myself it was incredibly validating and powerful to see myself reflected in places and times that I've been told for most of my life were straight by default. I was equally enthralled to learn about other experiences beyond my own – to get a glimpse of history won by trans and brown and deaf and ace young people. This book was recommended to me through Hoopla, which is a great resource for getting eBooks and audio books for free using your library card. I would highly recommend trying it to get a taste of this beautiful, mystical historical gem of a book.  </p>
 

 
            <br>
            <p>
            And if you like this book, and want more, don’t dispair! There are 3 books in the All Out series including “Out There: Into the Queer New Yonder” a antology of YA sci fi and futuristc stories with a queer twist. I would also recommend Toil & Trouble  A YA anthology of 15 stories featuring contemporary, historical, and futuristic  witchy heroines and This Is Our Rainbow, a LGBTQIA+ anthology written by a plethora of award winning authors specifically for tweens.

            <p>Persepolis is a poignant graphic memoir that chronicles the life of Marj Satrapi as she coming-of-age in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. Through striking black and white illustrations and a candid narrative, Satrapi explores themes of identity, political turmoil, and the challenges faced by a young girl navigating a changing society, offering a deeply personal and powerful account of her experiences.  </p>
            <br>

               <p> I first read this book as a young adult myself, at a time (recently post 9/11) when as Americans we were told a very single note story about Iran and other Muslim countries. Satrapi blew that narrative wide open for me, showing a very nuanced portrayal of her life in Iran. Marj’s childhood, like my own, was complicated and messy. She is, just as I was, going through the universal experience of growing up, feeling pulled between being a traditional good girl while also experiencing the anger and rebellion that comes with teenagerhood.  </p>
                <br>
                                
                
               <p> Persepolis has faced multiple bans and challenges. In 2013, the Chicago Public School System removed it from classrooms and libraries, citing "graphic language and images" as the reason. The book faced more challenges in different school districts and was the second most challenged book on ALA’s Top Ten List of Frequently Challenged Books for 2014.It is evident Islamophobia is playing a role in some of these challenges. For example, One challenging parent asked, “why a book about Muslims was assigned on September 11.”  while others expressed disappointment with its inclusion in a community wide book discussion on Muslim journeys around the world.  </p>
                <br>
                 <p>Despite the opposition, Persepolis continues to foster informed and nuanced discussions and understanding about Iran and the experiences of Islamic people. The very themes that have caused it to be challenged –that fact that it portrays Iranians not as veil wearing villains or anti-terrorist heroes’ but as complicated individuals– as humans just like anyone. Those very themes are what make it such a wonderful read. I would recommend this book to anyone, but because it is so much a coming-of-age story, dealing with themes of angst, I would highly recommend it to teens specifically. </p>
                
                 <br>
                
                <p>If your looking for more deliciously rebellious banned graphic novel reads, you can continue with Marj’s story in Persepolis 2. I also recommend the complete Maus and Gender Queer two other amazing graphic novel memoirs.</p>

            <p>Kaz Breaker has been offered the opportunity to gain unimaginable wealth. All he must do is steal, cheat, lie and pull the most dangerous heist the world has ever seen. Good thing he’s already a fearless young criminal mastermind. All Kaz needs now is a crew of teenage renegades, which he gathers from his experiences as the leader of a low-level gang on the streets of Ketterdam.  As readers follow this impossible mission throughout Leigh Bardugo’s fantasy novel, Six of Crows, we meet the fellow ne'er-do-wells who join Kaz on his journey.  

                There’s Inej Ghafa, A tight rope walking spy with the ability to scale any building undetected,  
                
                Jesper Fahey, A skilled marksman who’s never met a bet he can resist,  
                
                Nina Zenik, A Gisha witch with a knack for languages 
                
                , Matthias Helvar a former witch hunter who’s been imprisoned, 
                
                 and Wylan Van Eck an explosives expert from a prosperous merchant family. Each character has an opportunity to shine in Bardugo’s novel. As she takes us through all six of their perspectives chapter by chapter, she rounds each character with incredible depth so they feel much more like real young people than a specific stereotype or archetype. </p>
                 <br>
                 <p>        
                    Overall, Leigh Bardugo is an incredibly talented author and Six of Crows is a 5-star book. It includes an exhilarating surge of thrilling action, fully immersive and intricately crafted characters, and even a love story for those who go for that sort of thing. Lovers of fantasy, historical fiction and action will all be pleased with Bardugo's blending elements of fantastical Russian and Flemish History with the enchantment of The Hobbit, The gritty rabble of Oliver Twist, and the clever heist dynamics found in Ocean's 11.

            <p>  
                Pride and Prejudice has been given a new twist in Tirzah Price’s murder mystery retelling, Pride and Premeditation. In this version of events, we are trading in romance for adventure, swapping the bucolic countryside for the dirty streets of London, and following the exploits of a 16-year-old protagonist that is mostly the original Elizabeth Bennet we know and love, but with a bit of Sherlock Holmes, Elle Woods and Ruth Bader Ginsburg thrown in for good luck.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>This Lizzy wants desperately to prove herself at her father’s law firm , Longborn and Sons. So, when she hears of scandalous society murder and an innocent man in jail, she jumps at the chance to solve the case. There are many obstacles, and men, that stand in her way, none quite so frustrating as the stern and prideful Mr. Darcy, a competing solicitor at Pemberley Associates law firm. But as the case twists and turns, Lizzy learns that is she must rethink her own initial theories and put aside past prejudice, lest she become a murder victim herself! </p>
            <br>
            <p>Reading Pride and Premeditation is a lovely chance to revisit this familiar tale with a new and exciting twist. The characters have been updated to be very relatable to a modern teen audience, and the pacing of Lizzy’s sleuthing adventure really keeps the reader on their toes, wanting more. One standout criticism is that the character’s behavior can be a bit unbelievable for regency era England. The author admits in her end notes that she took liberties with historical accuracy to give Lizzy the ability to work outside the home, participate in law work and bring a modern sense of feminism to the story. But this choice degraded the real struggles and limitations faced by 19th century women. A huge part of Jane Austin’s Pride and Prejudice is in highlighting the ways that Regency laws and society stifled women and kept them stuck with few options and it is distracting to see these struggles treated so lightly in the retelling. But that being said, the novel does its job at being a fun, slightly dark and twisty mystery adventure. </p>

            <p>Terry Pratchett is often through of first as a great fantasy writer, but it cannot be denied that he has a wit and humor that permeates all his books. I have concluded that Terry absolutely must be a father, because his stories read like one big, silly, punny, delicious eye roll of a dad joke. This is particularly evident in his first novel for young adults, The Wee Free Men. In the story, the protagonist is a young girl named Tiffany Aching, whose family has lived on the same farm raising sheep for many many generations. As her father says, “The Aching family has always been Aching to stay, not Aching to leave!” But despite the Aching’s farm having been as normal as can be for as long as can be, Tiffany is about to learn not only is she a witch, but that a great and strange danger is coming their way.  She sets off to stop it, with the help of a talking toad, a frying pan, a band o’ rebellious 6-inch-tall men in kilts, and a mistic mentor named Miss. Tick.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>Pratchett is very aware of the stereotypes and archetypes that make up the fantasy and fairy tale genres. Part of the humor in this book comes from how he plays with those expectations. In some ways, Tiffany is a typical hero, an innocent ingénue embarking on a journey. At times Tiffany doesn't know what to do, is learning about herself and coming into her own. But early in the novel she is also able to defeat a headless horseman just by giving him a long judgmental stare in the eyes (eyes that he doesn't have, by the way, because he’s a HEAD less horseman). Other characters follow this same pattern. The warriors of the novel are certainly fierce and noble fighters able to hold their own, but they are also only 6 inches tall.  

                One of my favorite subversions is Tiffany’s grandmother – the “Caregiver” Archetype. We might expect a caregiving grandmother to be kind, soft, attentive and traditionally feminine. Granny Aching is anything but. She smells of turpentine, clonks around in big ol’ boots and puffs on Jolly Sailor (cheap and horrible pipe tobacco). Granny Aching is practically the town patriarch, more like John Wayne than a traditional grandmother. Both Granny and Tiffany struggle to communicate their affection for each other and when Granny dies, before the main action of the novel begins, Tiffany is left without a caregiver. Left with her own guilt and many unanswered questions about who her grandmother was. Yet throughout the novel she relives so many special memories that make it clear that granny was and still is a loving embodiment of the caregiver archetype, just in a bit more of a nontraditional wrapping.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>It is hard not to fall in love with the atypical characters of this silly, witty little novel. I very much enjoyed it and think anyone with a love of fantasy or humor would love it too. If you are a teen who grew up on Harry Potter or Lemony Snicket or Dav Pilkey, If you binged watched Stranger Things and lived for the moment  where When Suzie very nearly caused the deaths of all the main characters by insisting on a duet of "Never Ending Story", If you’ve ever watched the movie Labyrinth, or heard tell of Monty Python and The Holy Grail, well, then you might just like The Wee Free Men. And...the best part is, this is the first in a  five-book series on Tiffany Aching, within an even larger fantasy world of 41 Terry Pratchett discworld novels! So, give it a try! This mission, should you choose to accept it, means you’ve got lots of reading, adventuring, chuckling (and eye rolling) ahead of you! </p>

            <p>     A blackout has hit New York City. It’s the middle of a summer heat wave and now six sets of black teenagers must navigate the dark and their own feelings. The only way to find out what happens next is to pick out a copy of the blackout. Come with me as we explore this anthology a little further! </p>
                <br> 
                
                <p>  This novel written by 6 best selling and critically acclaimed black authors Dhonielle Clayton, Tiffany D. Jackson, Nic Stone, Angie Thomas, Ashley Woodfolk, and Nicola Yoon. Their intent is to create a work celebrating young black love and joy. Dhonielle Clayton says in best in this interview from Entertainment Weekly . She describes blackout as “"our love letter to love, to New York City, and to Black teens. Our reminder to them that their stories, their joy, their love are valid and worthy of being spotlighted." The novel’s dedication Eco's this sentiment saying "To Black kids everywhere: your stories, your joy, your love, and your lives matter. You are a light in the dark." </p>

                <br> 
                <p>   This novel is a series of interwoven short stories, so as readers, we travel through each of these teen’s stories as they unfold in the dark of the city, starting at one end of Manhattan, working downward and ending in Brooklyn. I thought the authors did an excellent job of interweaving these short stories together.  The novel is read less as a traditional short story anthology, and more as flashes from the lives of 6 interconnected friends and relatives. They reference each other, all have the same goal to make it to the same party in Brooklyn by the end of the night. And on a deeper level, their stories mirror and build off each other. As if the plot is a dance and the characters are all moving in step with each other, each of their actions serving as a familiar refrain all leading to a crescendo.  </p>

But in David Alexander Robertson’s beautifully stark graphic novel, Betty’s story has been given new life. I'd like to note here that while This book may contain Content disturbing to some younger readers, however It is presented very respectfully and would be appropriate for high school readers and high school class curriculum.

                In this Graphic novel we learn that Betty is an ambitious young woman living in Norway House, a remote area in Northern Manitoba, Canada. Betty embarks on a great adventure, leaving her home in Norway House to further her education and become a teacher. Tragically, Betty was never able to complete her education or return home to Norway House. On a dark night in 1971 she was approached by four men who, when she declined their invitation to party with them, kidnapped and eventually killed her. Betty’s murder was initially met with silence and indifference. But we cannot let that be the end of her story. She represents the over 6,000 native women in Canada and the United States who have been murdered or have gone missing. I encourage you to pick this graphic novel. Allow the stark lasting images of this text to tell you who Betty was, why she was important and what you can do to bring light to this issue.

               If you, like myself, are interested in victim focused true crime or graphic novel stories that highlight an indigonuse perspective, I also recommended checking out A Girl Called Echo by Katherena Vermette Surviving the City by Tasha Spillett and If I Go Missing by Brianna Jonnie,  </p>

            <p>This unique novel tells not one story, but several as it weaves through three generations of the
                Stephanides family. Cal (or Callie), the narrator and protagonist is a hermaphrodite man of Greek
                descent with a condition known as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which causes him to have certain
                feminine traits. He explains his own story by telling the journey of the family carrying the genetic
                defect that leads to his condition. The gene originates in Greece and migrates with Cal's grandparents
                from Smyrna to Detroit, Michigan. It then follows down the line passing to Cal's parents and finally
                taking hold in Cal him/herself. The story combines Greek culture, with the history of Detroit and the
                experiences of coming to terms with an intersex diagnosis. Jeffrey Eugenides, the author, decided to
                write Middlesex after he read the 1980 memoir Herculine Barbin and was unsatisfied with its discussion
                of intersex anatomy and emotions.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Even though it took me three weeks to read, this book was well worth it. As someone who grew up in
                Detroit, I felt excited, proud and sad to see the city depicted at it's most historical defining
                moments. It validated a city that I had come to view as decrepit and validated the experiences of my
                relatives who had lived it's history. As Cal's grandfather goes to work in the Ford Rouge plant, I saw
                my own grandfather taking in the smell and sweat of the factory. Durring the books depictions of the
                race riot I saw, not the Stephanides, but my own family, hiding in their attic as the city burned. I
                also felt very connected to Cal, and was glad to see a depiction of intersexness. The idea of
                experiencing aspects of both genders is so foreign to us, gender seems so black and white. I think
                Eugenides did a great job of showing how Cal could feel connected to both genders.</p>
                <br>
            <p>I don't know if this book really fits the YA genre like I originally thought. When I first began reading,
                I thought it was the story of a teenager who finds out they are intersex and their subsequent journey
                twards acceptance, bla bla bla, etc. I didn't realize that Cal's story of her confusing adolescence
                doesn't begin until half way through the book. I also think, because of the themes and references it
                presents, that Eugenides probably was writing to an adult audience. That being said, I'm glad I was
                confused because I loved this book and I don't think we should rule out YA readership. Maybe this book
                isn't for every teen reader, but it is for some. I think specific parts could be especially useful in
                history teaching, or as a way to give teens in the LGBTQ community a story of intersex experiences.</p>
