        </div>
        <div class="Section2"><p> 
            This case was a hard one for me!  It’s a complicated story with so many different players and I ended up diving really deep to try and understand the worlds of gangsta rap, police corruption and 1990s LA that all converge together in this case. I still feel I have so much to learn! One of the most enjoyable parts of this research was becoming more acquainted with Tupac and Biggie’s music. Rarely do we get insight into the thoughts and feelings and art of murder victims. I was grateful to get to listen to the art these men created and to get to know them a bit better through it!

                I really enjoyed researching this case, even as I found it incredibly frustrating that it has yet to be solved! As we discussed this case in our group, we really went back and forth – finding holes and plausibility in each of the major theories. However, one big upside to diving into an unsolved case like this, is it really gave me an opportunity to focus on Elizabeth Short and her life. And as I learned more about Elizabeth, I found myself asking what SHE would think of the name “Black Dahlia” and how she would feel about the notoriety and press attention surrounding her case.
